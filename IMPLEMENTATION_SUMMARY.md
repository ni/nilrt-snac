# Implementation Summary: Automatic Logging for nilrt-snac

## Overview

Successfully implemented Option 3 (Hybrid Multi-Stream Capture) for automatic logging of `configure` and `verify` operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Logging Module (`nilrt_snac/_logging.py`)
- **`_TeeStream` class**: Custom stream that duplicates writes to both console and log file
- **`logging_context()`**: Context manager that wraps command execution with logging
- **Error handling**: Fails fast on directory/file creation, warns on mid-execution failures
- **Metadata capture**: Logs include header with timestamp, command, user, hostname, platform info
- **Permissions management**: Automatically sets file permissions (0640) and group ownership (adm)

### 2. Integration with Main CLI (`nilrt_snac/__main__.py`)
- Import logging functionality
- Added `--no-log` flag to both `configure` and `verify` subcommands
- Wrapped command execution in `logging_context()`
- Prints log location at end of execution

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/integration/test_logging.py`)
10 test cases covering:
- ✓ Log file creation for verify command
- ✓ Correct file permissions and group ownership
- ✓ Log content includes header, body, and footer
- ✓ `--no-log` flag suppresses logging
- ✓ Configure dry-run creates logs
- ✓ Directory permissions are correct
- ✓ stderr is captured to logs
- ✓ Multiple runs create unique log files

### 4. Build System Updates (`Makefile`)
- Added log directory creation to `mkinstalldirs` target
- Added comment to `uninstall` explaining logs are preserved
- Directory created with mode 0750

### 5. Documentation (`docs/LOGGING.md`)
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Log location and naming convention
- Permissions and security
- Usage examples
- Log management and retention
- Error handling scenarios
- Troubleshooting guide
- Implementation details

## Requirements Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1. `configure` runs automatically logged | ✅ | `logging_context` wraps execution |
| 2. `verify` runs automatically logged | ✅ | `logging_context` wraps execution |
| 3. Logs only viewable by admin/adm group | ✅ | File perms 0640, group 'adm' |
| 4. Path notification at end | ✅ | `print_log_location()` function |
| 5. Logs stored under /var/log/nilrt-snac | ✅ | `LOG_DIR` constant |
| 6. Optional --no-log flag (MAY) | ✅ | Added to both subcommands |

## User Specifications Addressed

| Specification | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| Timestamp-only filenames | `command-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` format |
| Leave retention to admin | No auto-cleanup, documented in LOGGING.md |
| Dry-run generates logs | Logging enabled for dry-run mode |
| Directory creation fails operation | Raises SNACError before any changes |
| Mid-execution errors warn only | Try/except in _TeeStream.write() |
| Log prompts and answers | All stdout/stdin is captured |

## File Changes Summary

```
Created:
  nilrt_snac/_logging.py              (300 lines) - Core logging functionality
  tests/integration/test_logging.py   (340 lines) - Comprehensive test suite
  docs/LOGGING.md                     (250 lines) - User documentation

Modified:
  nilrt_snac/__main__.py              (+8 lines)  - Integration
  Makefile                            (+4 lines)  - Build system
```

## Key Features

1. **Zero-disruption**: All existing code works unchanged, no modifications to print statements needed
2. **Complete capture**: Gets all output including subprocess output from opkg
3. **Professional logs**: Structured with headers/footers and metadata
4. **Secure by default**: Proper permissions and group ownership automatically set
5. **Fail-safe**: Errors in logging don't crash the operation mid-execution
6. **Testable**: Comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases
7. **Documented**: Extensive user-facing documentation

## Testing

Tests can be run with:
```bash
sudo python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_logging.py -v
```

**Note**: Tests require root privileges to create files in `/var/log/`

## Example Output

```bash
$ sudo nilrt-snac verify
!! Running this tool will irreversibly alter the state of your system.    !!

Log saved to: /var/log/nilrt-snac/verify-20251015-143022.log
```

## Next Steps (Out of Scope for This Implementation)

- Update nilrt-snac-guide with logging documentation reference
- Add logrotate configuration example to package
- Consider adding log compression for old logs
- Add log viewer utility (optional)

## Design Decisions

### Why Option 3 (Hybrid Multi-Stream)?

1. **No code changes needed**: Works with existing print/logger statements
2. **Complete capture**: Gets everything including subprocess output
3. **Professional**: Proper log structure with metadata
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add features like rotation, compression

### Why fail on directory creation but warn on mid-execution errors?

- Directory creation happens before any system changes → safe to fail
- Mid-execution failures occur after changes started → must continue
- Provides best balance of safety and robustness

### Why preserve logs on uninstall?

- Logs are audit records that may be required for compliance
- Admins should explicitly decide when to delete logs
- Document recommends manual cleanup or logrotate

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows Clean Code principles
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (separate concerns)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Detailed docstrings
- ✅ Type hints where appropriate
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Follows existing codebase conventions
